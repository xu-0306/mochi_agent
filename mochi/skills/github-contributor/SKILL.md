# GitHub Contributor

Strategic guide for becoming an effective GitHub contributor and building your open-source reputation.

## The Strategy

**Core insight**: Many open-source projects have room for improvement. By contributing high-quality PRs, you:
- Build contributor reputation
- Learn from top codebases
- Expand professional network
- Create public proof of skills

## Contribution Types

### 1. Documentation Improvements

**Lowest barrier, high impact.**

- Fix typos, grammar, unclear explanations
- Add missing examples
- Improve README structure
- Translate documentation

```
Opportunity signals:
- "docs", "documentation" labels
- Issues asking "how do I..."
- Outdated screenshots or examples
```

### 2. Code Quality Enhancements

**Medium effort, demonstrates technical skill.**

- Fix linter warnings
- Add type annotations
- Improve error messages
- Refactor for readability

```
Opportunity signals:
- "good first issue" label
- "tech debt" or "refactor" labels
- Code without tests
```

### 3. Bug Fixes

**High impact, builds trust.**

- Reproduce and fix reported bugs
- Add regression tests
- Document root cause

```
Opportunity signals:
- "bug" label with reproduction steps
- Issues with many thumbs up
- Stale bugs (maintainers busy)
```

### 4. Feature Additions

**Highest effort, highest visibility.**

- Implement requested features
- Add integrations
- Performance improvements

```
Opportunity signals:
- "help wanted" label
- Features with clear specs
- Issues linked to roadmap
```

## Project Selection

### Good First Projects

| Criteria | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Active maintainers | PRs get reviewed |
| Clear contribution guide | Know expectations |
| "good first issue" labels | Curated entry points |
| Recent merged PRs | Project is alive |
| Friendly community | Supportive feedback |

### Red Flags

- No activity in 6+ months
- Many open PRs without review
- Hostile issue discussions
- No contribution guidelines

### Finding Projects

```bash
# GitHub search for good first issues
gh search issues "good first issue" --language=python --sort=created

# Search by topic
gh search repos "topic:cli" --sort=stars --limit=20

# Find repos you use
# Check dependencies in your projects
```

## PR Excellence

### Before Writing Code

```
Pre-PR Checklist:
- [ ] Read CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Check existing PRs for similar changes
- [ ] Comment on issue to claim it
- [ ] Understand project conventions
- [ ] Set up development environment
```

### Writing the PR

**Title**: Clear, conventional format

```
feat: Add support for YAML config files
fix: Resolve race condition in connection pool
docs: Update installation instructions for Windows
refactor: Extract validation logic into separate module
```

**Description**: Structured and thorough

```markdown

## Building Reputation

### The Contribution Ladder

Level 4: Maintainer status
```

### Consistency Over Volume

```

✅ 1-2 PRs per week, sustained
```

- Make massive changes without discussion
- Ghost after submitting

### Do
